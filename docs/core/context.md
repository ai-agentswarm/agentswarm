# Context

The `Context` object is the "blood" of the agent system. It flows through execution steps, carrying all necessary state, configuration, and history.

Crucially, **Agentswarm treats Context as immutable and isolated regarding execution flow**. When an agent forks or recurses, it typically operates on a *copy* of the context, ensuring that its local state changes (like thought processes or temporary variables) do not pollute the parent context or parallel execution branches unless explicitly merged back (usually via the Store).

## Key Components

A Context instance encapsulates:

1.  **Messages**: The conversation history (User messages, System prompts, Assistant replies).
2.  **Store**: A reference to the shared data store (see [Store](store.md)).
3.  **Tracing**: A reference to the tracing mechanism (see [Tracing](tracing.md)).
4.  **Feedback**: A reference to the feedback system (see [Feedback](feedback.md)).
5.  **Thoughts**: Internal reasoning steps generated by the agent during its execution.
6.  **Trace ID / Step ID**: Identifiers for observability and debugging.
